Instar Lullaby 
Drip, drip, drip, drip... 
Sunlit amber, yet to flow 
Future nestled in little pustules 
Unborn myriads, like gems 
Snuggled up to kin, to kin, to kin... 
(fig. I) 

Rice, banana, milk and pearls 
Tied in hungry knots to bulging flesh
Squealing, squirming
Ouroboros 
With obsidian baby gums 
Whispering sleepy wishes 
(fig. II) 

Waiting for the morning dew 
Strapped in leather belts, 
wood of roses, no thought of thorns
but a twitch, a wiggle 
Dreaming sleepy dreams of 
star-kissed skies and kisses, 
sweet as honey 
(fig. III) 

And at the crack and crunch of morning,
away with heavy blankets and the bed, too small
Display your chitin dress, 
your jeweled skin, your ornament and glass 
Be lovely and strange and 
skitter about freely 
(fig. Lost)
