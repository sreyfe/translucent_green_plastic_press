Instar Lullaby 

Drip, drip, drip, drip... 

Sunlit amber, yet to flow 

Future nestled in little pustules 

Unborn myriads, like gems 

Snuggled up to kin, to kin, to kin... 

(fig. I) 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Rice, banana, milk and pearls 

Tied in hungry knots to bulging flesh

Squealing, squirming

Ouroboros 

With obsidian baby gums 

Whispering sleepy wishes 

(fig. II) 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
Waiting for the morning dew 

Strapped in leather belts, 

wood of roses, no thought of thorns

but a twitch, a wiggle 

Dreaming sleepy dreams of 

star-kissed skies and kisses, 

sweet as honey 

(fig. III) 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
And at the crack and crunch of morning,

away with heavy blankets and the bed, too small

Display your chitin dress, 

your jeweled skin, your ornament and glass 

Be lovely and strange and 

skitter about freely 

(fig. Lost)
